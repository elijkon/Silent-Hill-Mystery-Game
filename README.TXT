This game is called Silent Hill. You play as the character Jamie and Cheryl as you
try to save the town Silent Hill from the weird mysterious fog that has taken over.
It also seems that you and Cheryl are the only people left in Silent Hill. In order to
save Silent Hill you must turn on the lighthouse by starting it in the fuel room. You have 
10 minutes to find everything you need. If you start having a hard time doing it in that time
there is a syringe somewhere that will increase your time limit by 3 minutes. The command
"on" is for electricty and "start" is for the lighthouse. In order to find items
you must type look and if there are items in a room the game will tell you. 

To start this application, create an instance of class "Game" and call its
"play" method.
